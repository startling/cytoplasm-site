<h1 id="features-design">Features &amp; Design:</h1>
<p>Cytoplasm is a simple-ish static site compiler. It's meant to be used mostly as a blogging engine, though it <a href="#cytoplasm-is-easily-extensible">can be used for more than that</a>. Here are some things you might like about it:</p>
<h2 id="cytoplasm-is-portable">Cytoplasm is Portable</h2>
<p>A Cytoplasm site is defined completely by its configuration and its contents. The output is just a set of plain html files, and so can be hosted just about anywhere. <code>cytoplasm</code>, the script, will run anywhere where Python is installed -- it's tested and works in Pythons 2.7.2 and 3.2.</p>
<h2 id="cytoplasm-is-easily-extensible">Cytoplasm is Easily Extensible</h2>
<p>Cytoplasm interpreters are python functions in your configuration file. The markdown one, for example, is just:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">markdown</span>
<span class="n">markdown_extensions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;abbr&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;footnotes&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;toc&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;fenced_code&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;headerid&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nd">@Interpreter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;markdown&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;md&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">markdown_interpreter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">destination</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">markdown</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">markdownFromFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">destination</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">extensions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">markdown_extensions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">encoding</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;utf8&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">safe</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Similarly, Cytoplasm controllers are classes that inherit from a base class in the cytoplasm module.</p>

<p>This source of this site (compiled by Cytoplasm, of course) can be cloned from <code>https://startling@github.com/startling/cytoplasm-site.git</code>. Everything works within a git repository; in fact, you'll be missing a lot if you don't use one. Controllers can be installed as git submodules. Pull and push wherever you want!</p>
