<p>Cytoplasm is a simple-ish static site compiler. It's meant to be used mostly as a blogging engine, though it <a href="#cytoplasm-is-easily-extensible">can be used for more than that</a>. Here are some things you might like about it:</p>
<h2 id="cytoplasm-is-portable">Cytoplasm is Portable</h2>
<p>A Cytoplasm site is defined completely by its configuration and its contents. The output is just a set of plain html files, and so can be hosted just about anywhere. <code>cytoplasm</code>, the script, will run anywhere where Python is installed -- it's tested and works in Pythons 2.7.2 and 3.2.</p>
<h2 id="cytoplasm-is-easily-extensible">Cytoplasm is Easily Extensible</h2>
<p>Cytoplasm interpreters are python functions in your configuration file. The markdown one, for example, is just:</p>
<pre><code class="python">import markdown
markdown_extensions = ['abbr', 'footnotes', 'toc', 'fenced_code', 'headerid']
def markdown_interpreter(file, destination):
    markdown.markdownFromFile(input=file, output=destination,
            extensions = markdown_extensions, encoding=&quot;utf8&quot;, safe=False)
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, Cytoplasm controllers are classes that inherit from a base class in the cytoplasm module.</p>
<h2 id="cytoplasm-integrates-well-with-git">Cytoplasm Integrates Well With Git</h2>
<p>This source of this site (compiled by Cytoplasm, of course) can be cloned from <code>https://startling@github.com/startling/cytoplasm-site.git</code>. Everything works within a git repository; in fact, you'll be missing a lot if you don't use one. Controllers can be installed as git submodules. Pull and push wherever you want!</p>
