<h1 id="welcome-to-cytoplasm">Welcome to Cytoplasm!</h1>
<p>This is Cytoplasm, a simple static blogging-and-other-things generator. Cytoplasm takes some posts and templates and outputs a bunch of HTML files, which you can host basically anywhere. Since everything is plain text, using version control and making back-ups are both super easy.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>You'll need <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html">pip</a> to get started. (Side note: this example will only work in Python 2.x, sorry; python-scss doesn't support 3 yet. If you're set on using Python 3, though, read on: Cytoplasm itself is fully compatible with Python 3.x.)</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c"># install cytoplasm -- pip will install cytoplasm&#39;s dependencies.</span>
pip install cytoplasm
<span class="c"># install this site&#39;s dependencies.</span>
pip install markdown scss pyyaml
<span class="c"># make a directory for your site and change into it.</span>
mkdir cytoplasm-site
<span class="nb">cd </span>cytoplasm-site
<span class="c"># initialize this site.</span>
cytoplasm init cytoplasm
<span class="c"># build the site..</span>
cytoplasm build
<span class="c"># serve it!</span>
cytoplasm serve
</pre></div>


<p>Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> and you'll have a local replica of this website running. How's that for recursion? Douglas Hofstadter would be proud.</p>
<p>After you spend a few moments in awe, you can quit the web server with ctrl-C.</p>
<h2 id="your-very-own-site">Your Very Own Site</h2>
<p>Now that you can see the edges of how Cytoplasm works, you're probably bounding with unharnessed creativity. Don't worry. It's easy. </p>
<p>We're going to start from the beginning here, but feel free to just edit the files you got above. You might want to pretend to follow along, though, just to get the hang of things:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c"># make a new directory and change into it.</span>
mkdir bounding_creativity
<span class="nb">cd </span>bounding_creativity
<span class="c"># Initialize the bare cytoplasm site here.</span>
cytoplasm init bare
<span class="c"># make the `_posts` directory</span>
mkdir _posts
</pre></div>


<p>Let's make an example post and put it into our <code>_posts</code> directory as <code>creativity.html.markdown</code>, just for kicks.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">&lt;!--</span> <span class="n">metadata</span>
<span class="n">title:</span> <span class="n">Unbounded</span> <span class="n">Creativity</span>
<span class="n">date:</span> <span class="mi">2011</span><span class="sr">/12/</span><span class="mi">17</span>
<span class="n">tags:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">creativity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cytoplasm</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">--&gt;</span>

<span class="n">Oh</span> <span class="n">man</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Cytoplasm</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">_so_</span> <span class="n">exciting</span><span class="o">!</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first part of this is an html comment that includes all of your metadata -- you <em>need</em> to have the first two elements, <code>title</code> and <code>date</code>. Everything else is optional, and you can put whatever you want.</p>
<p>For now, though, see what you've got with <code>cytoplasm serve -r</code>. Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> again and you'll see your glorious content framed in half-assed html.</p>
<p>Keep the server running for now; <code>cytoplasm serve -r</code> will rebuild the site every time you make a change to the source.</p>
